## Overview
This is a web application that stores the location of fish species, based on a user's own encounter/knowledge on a particular species.  The database will already have a full list of Hawaiian reef fish, and a user can create an account where they can choose and store a list of fishes they have encountered and the location of where they encountered them.  It will be saved in their own list for reference.  Those without accounts can enter a species location, but they will not be able to save a list.

The main page will contain an image of Oahu, and a predetermined set of "clickable" locations.  Each location will have statistics on the abundance of various fish based on the information provided by site users.  These will be the most basic functions of the website, and will be the main focus.

Extended functions include users contributing their own data on species of fish not already included in the database, and perhaps their own individual maps of personal encounters.  For now, the application will only handle a single island.

Possible issues include temporal change in fish locations and incorrect information (spamming, etc), although reef species tend to be static, and entries will be moderated by administrators.

The idea of the website is to provide specific locations for reef species and their overall relative abundance in an area depending on the amount of sightings by users.  This will give snorkelers, divers, and fishermen a good idea of where to find species of interest.  The database will also offer detailed information for each fish, and their abundance for each area of the island.
