## Overview

## Approach
The core components for this application, at least for the first deliverable, will be the map and reef fish database.  For the map, we will be utilizing the Google Maps Javascript API, and integrating it within our application so that we will be able to map the coastal areas of the island to specific names.  When a user clicks in a defined area on the map, a description will be provided with a list of fish species, and a user will be able to add a fish that they have spotted to this location.  A user can also choose not to click on a specific location, and instead have the app geolocation function automatically detect where they are.  This is useful for on-the-go fish adding, or if the user do not know their current location.

The exact calculation for abundance ratings for each fish is still being considered, but for now it will be a percentage termed "sighting rate", and will be based on the number of times seen by users compared to other fishes in the area.  Each location will have sighting rates independent of other locations.  

As for the reef fish database, it will contain a good amount of common reef fish, and there will be a detailed description with each species along with areas that they were sighted in, along with their respective sighting rates for each area.  At least for the first deliverable, this database will be limited to Hawaiian species.  

A login system will be implemented where users can view the fishes that they have sighted themselves.  Although right now the options are limited for members, there will be communial features added that will make the application more community friendly.  These options are discussed in the deliverables.

## Deliverable 1

## Deliverable 2
Adding to the previous functionality of the application, the users will be able to (...).  In addition, we will have update documentation for other developers to build and use our application.  We will use the Play Framework for our application and incorporate integration testing.
## Deliverable 3
Adding to the application's functionality will be a fully functional database with the detailed information about the reef fishes.  (...).  Just like with our previous deliverable, we will update our documentation and do testing on our application.
