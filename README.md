## Overview
Although there are many fish databases available, there are few applications that quickly lets an individual observe the reef fish ecology occurring in their local area.  Reef Nexus is a crowd-sourced application aimed towards divers and fishermen which stores the location of fish species, based on a user's own encounter/knowledge with that particular species.  The initial application will survey the Hawaiian Islands, and the database will have a full list of Hawaiian reef fish.  A user can create an account where they can choose and store a list of fishes they have encountered and the location of where they encountered them.  It will be saved in their own list for reference.  Those without accounts can enter a species location, but they will not be able to save a list.

The main page will contain a map of a default location (Oahu for now) or the user's own current location.  Each location will have statistics on the abundance of various fish based on the information provided by site users.  These will be the most basic functions of the website, and will be the main focus.

Extended functions include users contributing their own data on species of fish not already included in the database, and perhaps their own individual maps of personal encounters.

Possible issues include temporal change in fish locations and incorrect information (spamming, etc), although reef species tend to be static, and entries will be moderated by administrators.

The ultimate goal of the application is to provide ocean-enthusiasts with information on the abundance of various fish species in a specific area, so they have an idea of what they will encounter.  This will give snorkelers, divers, and fishermen a good idea of where to find species of interest.  The database will also offer detailed information for each fish, along with their abundancy for all areas in which they occur in.  

## Approach

## Deliverable 1
Users will be able to add to the database of where they saw a particular fish.  In the fish database, the user will be able to search for a fish given certain parameters.  However, the fish database won't be implemented until later.  Another functionality is that given a location on an image of Oahu, our application will be able to display the fishes found at that location and its sighting rate.  Users will be able to sign in to add fishes, check their sighting and see a record of their record activity.
## Deliverable 2
Adding to the previous functionality of the application, the users will be able to
## Deliverable 3
Adding to the application's functionality will be a fully functional database with the detailed information about the reef fishes.
