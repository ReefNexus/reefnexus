<b>Reef Nexus</b> is a web application that offers insight on the relative occurrence of fish species within various locations.  Targeted towards ocean enthusiasts, the application takes crowd-sourced information to provide these censuses.  When users observe a particular fish species in an area, they can report the sighting to Reef Nexus where it will be contributed to the sighting rate in that area.  Within each locale in Reef Nexus, users can view the most commonly sighted fish species, and also fishes that do not occur frequently.  To aid in adding fish, or perhaps just for one's curiosity, a fish identification feature will also be added.

Although there are many fish databases available, there are few applications that allow users to quickly find local areas with their preferred fish species.  The Reef Nexus team aims to create this application along with an easy-to-navigate and intuitive interface for users to use along coastal areas and even in the water.

- <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>
- <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Deployed on Heroku</a>
