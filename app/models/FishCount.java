/**
 * Contains the number of fish of a given species in a particular Location.
 *
 * During the in-memory phase of this project, this was handled as a Map<Long, Long> in the Location model where the
 * keys were Fish IDs and the values were the number of fish of that type in the Location.  However, Postgres does not
 * handle Maps as far as this developer can tell.  The easiest solution would have been to add a column to the table
 * joining the Location and Fish tables, but since the Play framework abstracts everything so heavily this developer
 * has no idea how to actually accomplish that.  (This also marks the first time in recorded history that this
 * developer has actually wanted to work with raw SQL.)  Consequently, this class is sort of a custom-made join table
 * that uses a ManyToOne annotation to refer to the Location while only storing the ID number of the corresponding Fish;
 * trying to handle ManyToOne relationships to both tables was proving troublesome, thus the use of an ID number rather
 * than the actual Fish instance.
