Targeted towards ocean enthusiasts, the application takes crowd-sourced information to provide these censuses.  When users observe a particular fish species in an area, they can report the sighting to Reef Nexus where it will be contributed to the sighting rate in that area.  Within each locale in Reef Nexus, users can view the most commonly sighted fish species, and also fishes that do not occur frequently.  To aid in adding fish, or perhaps just for one's curiosity, a fish identification feature will also be added.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are many fish databases available, there are few applications that allow users to quickly find local areas with their preferred fish species.  The Reef Nexus team aims to create this application along with an easy-to-navigate and intuitive interface for users to use along coastal areas and even in the water.  \r\n\r\n<b>Reef Nexus is built upon:</b>\r\n- <a href=\"https://www.playframework.com/\">Play Framework 2.3.8</a>\r\n- <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/\">Twitter Bootstrap</a>\r\n- <a href=\"https://www.heroku.com/\">Deployed on Heroku</a>\r\n- Heavily utilizes the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/\">Google Maps API</a>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wengdg/reefnexus/master/docs/images/mainpage.PNG\" width=\"75%\"/>\r\n\r\n<b>Additional features:</b>\r\n- Comprehensive fish database which includes species-specific information \r\n- Option for users to log in to add and view their own sightings\r\n\r\n<b>Features to be implemented:</b>\r\n- An easy identification feature which allows users to easily identify a fish which they cannot\r\n- Ability for other users to identify an unidentified fish\r\n\r\n<b>The application is currently being demoed within the main Hawaiian Islands</b>\r\n\r\n##Documentation and Useful Links\r\n- <a href=\"https://www.reefnexus.com\">Reef Nexus Application</a>\r\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/wengdg/reefnexus/wiki/Developer-Guide\">Developer Guide</a>\r\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/wengdg/reefnexus/wiki/User-Guide\">Navigating Reef Nexus</a>\r\n- <a href=\"http://wengdg.github.io/reefnexus/\">Reef Nexus GitHub Page</a>\r\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/wengdg/reefnexus/wiki/Contact-Us>Contact Us Directly</a>\r\n\r\n##Contributing and Contact\r\n- Please submit issues or improvements to the <a href=\"https://github.com/wengdg/reefnexus/issues\">Reef Nexus issues page</a>. \r\n- To directly get in contact with the Reef Nexus team, please visit our <a href=\"https://github.com/wengdg/reefnexus/wiki/Contact-Us\">contact page</a>.\r\n\r\n##Licenses\r\n- Reef Nexus is licensed under the <a href=\"https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\">Apache 2.0</a> license.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
